here we are talking about inheritance
Inheritance simply means base classes and parent class
Sometimes some informations is common for a group of things at that time we can use this method.

class Specs:
    def __init__(self,brand_name,shape,scratch_resistance):
        self.brand_name = brand_name
        self.shape = shape
        self.scratch_resistance = scratch_resistance
    
class sun_glasses(Specs):
    def __init__(self,brand_name,shape,scratch_resistance,coating):
        
        '''the init function we have to call again as the child init function
           ovwerwrites it.'''
        # Specs.__init__(self,brand_name,shape,scratch_resistance)
        # super().__init__(brand_name,shape,scratch_resistance)
        Specs.brand_name = brand_name
        Specs.shape = shape
        Specs.scratch_resistance = scratch_resistance
        self.coating = coating
        
    
    def printing(self):
        print("I have bought sun_glasses of",Specs.brand_name,"having shape",Specs.shape,"and coating",self.coating)
        
obj = sun_glasses("Fastrack","Oval",True,True)
obj.printing()
